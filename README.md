# ChatWeSIS 🤖📊  
*Conversational AI for Social Policy Data Discovery*

ChatWeSIS is an AI-powered chatbot integrated into the [WeSIS](https://wesis.org/) platform to assist researchers in discovering, navigating, and understanding global social policy datasets. Built using LangChain, vector-based retrieval, and large language models (LLMs), it offers a natural language interface for exploring complex indicators, uploading data, and improving data reusability.
